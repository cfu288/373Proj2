  each course is 60. The total number of students is 80. Each student is required to register for 
  5 courses.

  Included with this project are 12 files:
  Driver.java, the main file associated with the program also contains main
  Course.java, the file responsible for keeping track the capacity of a course, it's name and remaining spots
  Student.java, the file which contains the preferences of the student, the student's name and assigned courses
  ObjectPool.java, this file manages thread access to our courses using the singleton pattern with double locking.
  SuperObjectPool.java, the file that contains the declaration of attributes and methods of the object pool
  Results.java, the file that is in charge of print out the results for all students
  StdoutDisplayInterface.java, the file that contains the interface implemented by results
  CreateWorkers.java, the file that creates NUM_THREADS threads (via the threaded class WorkerThread), start them and join on them.
  WorkerThread.java, the file that contains the algorithm to enroll a student in courses
  FileProcessor.java, the file that contains the methods to read from a file and write in one.
